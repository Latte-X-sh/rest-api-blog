# Getting Started

First clone the repository from Github and switch to the new directory:

$ git clone git@github.com:Latte-X-sh/rest-api-blog.git

Usage

To start your own project:
Existing virtualenv

If your project is already in an existing python3 virtualenv first install the following requirements in the requirements.txt file.

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

Then simply apply the migrations:

$ python manage.py migrate

You can now run the development server:

$ python manage.py runserver

No virtualenv

This assumes that python3 is linked to valid installation of python 3 and that pip is installed and pip3is valid for installing python 3 packages.

Installing inside virtualenv is recommended, however you can start your project without virtualenv too.

But for the sake of this tutorial kindly
download virtualenv or virtualenv wrapper
to follow through.
